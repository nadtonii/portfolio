                    <p>Healthcare Croatia is a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to streamline the process of finding and booking medical services in Croatia. The platform connects patients with their doctors and clinics, making it easier to access quality healthcare services.</p>
                    <p>The app provides features like appointment scheduling, medical history tracking, and direct communication with doctors.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>The challenge</h2>
                    <p>The main challenge was to create an intuitive platform that would simplify the complex healthcare system in Croatia. The solution needed to cater to both patients seeking medical services and healthcare workers managing their practices.</p>
                    <p>Key challenges included creating a seamless booking system, ensuring data privacy compliance, and designing an interface that would be accessible to users of all ages.</p>

                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p>Research revealed several critical issues in the Croatian healthcare system:</p>
                            <ul class="research-list">
                                <li>Long waiting times for appointments (3-6 months on average)</li>
                                <li>Difficulty finding available specialists in the area</li>
                                <li>No way to compare doctors based on patient experiences</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I addressed these by creating a real-time availability system, location-based doctor search, and a verified review system to help patients make informed decisions.</p>
